MAGICIAN,The Magician,The DIY Creator,hot.glue.havoc,"With hands that move faster than a toddler near an open paint can, The Magician is every DIY overlord on social media. This card rules the Craftiness Realm and can turn toilet paper rolls into a chandelier or make a gourmet dinner out of three sad fridge items. Don't worry, you're not alone.

HERMIT,The Hermit,The Niche Meme Page,lord.hermit.crab,"The Hermit is your favorite anonymous shitposter, lurking in the shadows with niche memes so good they‚Äôre borderline art.

LOVERS,The Lovers,The Couples Content Creator,oversharing4clout,"This card embodies love, harmony, and two people who absolutely cannot do anything without a ring light. These duos have turned their relationship into a full-blown business, complete with matching outfits and oversharing as a brand strategy. These people are one step away from a joint Facebook account.

JUDGMENT,Judgment,The Drama Tea Spiller,drama.receipts.only,"Judgment is the ruler of messy receipts, breathless expos√©s, and comment sections that go on longer than a CVS receipt.

DEVIL,The Devil,The Hustle Bro,grind.or.die.trying,"Welcome to grindset hell, where the only thing scarier than the Devil is his LinkedIn profile. This card represents the self-proclaimed moguls who think taking a day off is a war crime.

DEATH,Death,The Rebranded Creator,rip.old.brand,"Death doesn‚Äôt mean the end ‚Äî it means the algorithm tanked, so now it‚Äôs time to pivot. This card is for influencers who have reinvented themselves more times than your Netflix password. One day, they‚Äôre doing smoky-eye tutorials; the next, they‚Äôre explaining how to invest in alpaca farms. Their old niche? Dead. Their new niche?

If Jake Paul can become a boxer who fights senior citizens, anything is possible.","Hey guys, I know this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre used to, but I‚Äôm so excited to launch my new series: ‚ÄòMeal Prepping for Gamers Who Believe in Astrology.‚Äô Let‚Äôs grow together!",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eda68826ee209a6672_4_A3_S9.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/67617f6a37c381815b55ff4b_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot-min.jpg,
SUN,The Sun,The Positivity Creator,hype.and.delusion,"The Sun is all about relentless optimism and making you feel like a trash human for not hand-weaving a blanket for your cat‚Äôs birthday.

TEMPERANCE,Temperance,The Balanced Life Coach,zen.guru,"Temperance is that influencer who insists you can achieve inner peace and a six-figure income if you just wake up at 5 a.m. and stop eating carbs. They‚Äôre part life coach, part cult leader, and 100% convinced they‚Äôve cracked the code to existence.

HANGED_MAN,The Hanged Man,The Burnt-Out Creator,content.dead.inside,"This card is for influencers who‚Äôve hit the content wall so hard their burnout has a subscriber count. Their ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù posts are basically a seasonal tradition, and their fans have grown weirdly good at predicting when it‚Äôs coming.
