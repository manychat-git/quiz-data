HIGH_PRIESTESS,The High Priestess: The Wellness Guru,"This one’s for the CBD-and-crystal queens out there just being witchy and burning sage. The High Priestess is mysterious, intuitive, and probably sponsored by Moon Juice. Her captions are 80% astrology, 20% questions like, “What’s your aura telling you today?” She’s the reason #manifesting has more hashtags than the word ""career."" Stevie Nicks cosplay not included.","Typical post: “The energy shift you’re feeling is Saturn, not your ex. Just breathe through it, babes.” ",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5e9100ba2c1da811eef_4_A3_S8.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
FOOL,The Fool: The Viral Prankster,"You’re here for the chaos (and, as this is the Internet, you’re in good company). The Fool is the archetype for pranksters, clout chasers, and anyone who thinks dangling off a skyscraper without a harness is a personality. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, they’re the main characters in every “You won’t believe what happens next” Reel. Bottle of PRIME and internet slang not included, rizzler.",Typical post: “I filled my friend’s Cyber Truck with packing peanuts!”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eda68826ee209a6672_4_A3_S9.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
MAGICIAN,The Magician: The DIY Creator,"With hands that move faster than a toddler near an open paint can, The Magician is every DIY overlord on social media. This card rules the Craftiness Realm and can turn toilet paper rolls into a chandelier or make a gourmet dinner out of three sad fridge items. Don't worry, you're not alone. They're making art out of plungers and screws, meanwhile we're eating shredded cheese out of the bag like a gremlin.",Typical post: A sped-up voiceover explaining how to make a wedding dress entirely out of hot glue and sheer chaos.,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eea68826ee209a66aa_4_A4_S3.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
TOWER,The Tower: The Canceled Influencer,"Oh no. When The Tower appears, your feed is about to go down in flames. You’ve pissed off the algo and there’s no coming back. This card belongs to the problematic creators who didn’t read the room — or the Terms of Service. They’re always one Notes App apology away from a complete rebrand.",Typical post: “I’ve made a lot of mistakes and I’m stepping back to reflect. Please respect my privacy.”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5f079a177afceeb0e8b_4_A5_S8.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
EMPRESS,The Empress: The Aesthetic Overlord,"All hail the moodboard. The Empress reigns over every impeccably curated grid you’ve ever seen. These influencers live for soft lighting, neutral tones, and plants that definitely cost more than your rent. Because having rich parents allows for a lifestyle most of us can't afford, curated identity included.",Typical post: A flat lay of an oat milk latte next to a field journal. Caption: “Find beauty in the little things. 🌿✨”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5f0d664adff91234031_4_A5_S1.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
HERMIT,The Hermit: The Niche Meme Page,"The Hermit is your favorite anonymous shitposter, lurking in the shadows with niche memes so good they’re borderline art. They have a cult following but could walk past their biggest fan on the street without being recognized.","Typical post: A meme about existential dread captioned, ""Me after accidentally liking my crush’s 2009 vacation photo,"" paired with a screenshot of Tony Soprano staring into the abyss.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a50b91ed848dbeb0dcec_4_A3_S6.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
LOVERS,The Lovers: The Couples Content Creator,"This card embodies love, harmony, and two people who absolutely cannot do anything without a ring light. These duos have turned their relationship into a full-blown business, complete with matching outfits and oversharing as a brand strategy. These people are one step away from a joint Facebook account. No one likes anyone that much.

Bonus points if they post a breakup video with 10 mid-roll ads.",Typical post: “We handcuffed ourselves together for 72 hours and it ended with one of us crying in a Taco Bell parking lot (not clickbait)!”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5e5e86eb7e0cb530ca6_4_A4_S10.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
JUDGMENT,Judgment: The Drama Tea Spiller,"Judgment is the ruler of messy receipts, breathless exposés, and comment sections that go on longer than a CVS receipt. These creators will pause exactly one frame to show a blurry screenshot that changes everything. If it happened online, they’ve already got a timeline, an analysis, and probably a merch line saying, ""I was here for the tea.""
","Typical post: A YouTube thumbnail with their face frozen mid-gasp, a red arrow pointing at a random Starbucks cup, and the title: ""HE LIED?!? THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ICED VANILLA LATTE SCANDAL 💀☕""",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a50a5b10b04a02efd4b7_4_A2_S6.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
DEVIL,The Devil: The Hustle Bro,"Welcome to grindset hell, where the only thing scarier than the Devil is his LinkedIn profile. This card represents the self-proclaimed moguls who think taking a day off is a war crime. They’ll sell you a $5,000 course called How to Monetize Your Existence and make you question why you don’t already own a private island. My dude, being obsessed with The Wolf of Wall Street is not a good look.","Typical post: “Woke up at 4 a.m., cold-plunged into a bathtub of oat milk, flipped three NFTs, and pitched a startup idea to my dog. What’s your excuse?”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a50a1fdeaed1bd85ca90_4_A2_S2.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
CHARIOT,The Chariot: The Fitness Influencer,"Determined. Relentless. Sweaty. Chances of saying “rise and grind"" are extremely high.

The Chariot is the influencer whose gym selfies and motivational captions make you feel guilty about that fourth slice of pizza. They’ve got a supplement sponsor and a catchphrase like “Always bringing it!”",Typical post: A shirtless post-workout mirror pic. Caption: “Discipline > Motivation. Check this fit. What did YOU do today?”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5e9100ba2c1da811eef_4_A3_S8.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
DEATH,Death: The Rebranded Creator,"Death doesn’t mean the end — it means the algorithm tanked, so now it’s time to pivot. This card is for influencers who have reinvented themselves more times than your Netflix password. One day, they’re doing smoky-eye tutorials; the next, they’re explaining how to invest in alpaca farms. Their old niche? Dead. Their new niche? Probably also doomed, but hey, they’ve got a Canva logo for it. 

If Jake Paul can become a boxer who fights senior citizens, anything is possible.","Typical post: “Hey guys, I know this isn’t what you’re used to, but I’m so excited to launch my new series: ‘Meal Prepping for Gamers Who Believe in Astrology.’ Let’s grow together!”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eda68826ee209a6672_4_A3_S9.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
SUN,The Sun: The Positivity Creator,"The Sun is all about relentless optimism and making you feel like a trash human for not hand-weaving a blanket for your cat’s birthday. These creators are so cheerful, it’s borderline threatening. If their feed doesn’t make you cry happy tears while simultaneously questioning your life choices, are they even doing it right?",Typical post: A wholesome video of them surprising their mom with a new car. Caption: “Started with $5 and a dream. Now Mom never has to drive her 2003 Honda again. 🌞💛 #Blessed #GrindPaysOff”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eea68826ee209a66aa_4_A4_S3.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
TEMPERANCE,Temperance: The Balanced Life Coach,"Temperance is that influencer who insists you can achieve inner peace and a six-figure income if you just wake up at 5 a.m. and stop eating carbs. They’re part life coach, part cult leader, and 100% convinced they’ve cracked the code to existence. Their feed is a mix of pseudo-philosophy, overpriced planner ads, and smoothies that look like lawnmower clippings.","Typical post: “How I scaled my empire to 7 figures while meditating, journaling, and teaching my cat Spanish.”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5f079a177afceeb0e8b_4_A5_S8.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
HANGED_MAN,The Hanged Man: The Burnt-Out Creator,"This card is for influencers who’ve hit the content wall so hard their burnout has a subscriber count. Their “taking a break” posts are basically a seasonal tradition, and their fans have grown weirdly good at predicting when it’s coming. Will they return with a rebrand or quietly disappear to work at their cousin’s startup? Only the algorithm knows.","Typical post: A selfie of them staring wistfully into the distance. Caption: “Social media is so toxic, but I’ll miss you guys. Except I probably won’t. Bye for now… or forever. IDK.”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5f0d664adff91234031_4_A5_S1.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
WHEEL_OF_FORTUNE,The Wheel of Fortune: The One-Hit Wonder,"The Wheel of Fortune is the influencer equivalent of hitting the lottery… and immediately losing the ticket. One viral post launched them into fame, and now they’re clinging to relevance like their life depends on it.","Typical post: A poorly edited video titled, “Y’all loved the first one, so here’s me recreating it… but with my grandma this time! 😂🔥 #ForYou #PleaseGoViralAgain”",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a50b91ed848dbeb0dcec_4_A3_S6.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
HIEROPHANT,The Hierophant: The Educator,"The Hierophant is the all-knowing content creator who turns every niche fact into a TED Talk you didn’t ask for but now can’t stop watching. They’ve got charts, sources, and a whiteboard that’s seen some things. Whether they’re dissecting conspiracy theories or explaining why your moisturizer is literally ruining your life, their energy screams, “I have a slide deck for that.”",Typical post: “Here’s why the Roman Empire lives rent-free in your brain — and what it has to do with oat milk lattes. #NicheButMakeItFascinating”,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/6745a5eda68826ee209a6672_4_A3_S9.avif,https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b0cbf53f3798cc2ace2b05/676171914fa66732b5303528_Instagram%20story%20-%20tarot.avif
